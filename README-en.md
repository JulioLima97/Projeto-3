# Project-3
## Project description
In this project I am an analyst on the Crankshaft List. Hundreds of free vehicle advertisements are published on their website every day, and I was responsible for needing to study the data found over the past few years and determine what factors influenced the price of a vehicle.

## Data description
The dataset contains the following fields:

- `price`: price
- `model_year`: model year
- `model`: model
- `condition`: condition
- `cylinders`: cylinder
- `fuel: fuel`: gasoline, diesel etc.
- `odometer`: the vehicle's mileage when the advertisement was published
- `transmission`: transmission
- `painting_color`: color
- `is_4wd`: if the vehicle is 4 by 4 (Boolean type)
- `date_posted`: data that the advertisement was published
- `days_listed`: days from publication to withdrawal

## Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Libraries
- pandas

Note: This project was developed based on the guidance I received to improve my logical reasoning as a student. As a result, we even maintain all requested orders related to guidance for carrying out the necessary calculations.
